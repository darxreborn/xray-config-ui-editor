The most advanced, static web-based GUI for **Xray-core**. Manage your configurations with ease, visualize traffic flow, and sync directly with **Remnawave Panel**. No backend required — it runs entirely in your browser.

## ✨ Features

- 🛠 **Full Config Support**: Complete management of Inbounds, Outbounds, Routing, DNS, and Policy.
- ☁️ **Remnawave Integration**: Direct sync via API (Credentials or API Token). Load and save profiles to your cloud panel instantly.
- 🕸 **Visual Topology**: Interactive traffic flow graph powered by React Flow.
- 🛡 **Reality Tooling**: Built-in X25519 key generator for Reality security.
- 📝 **Dual Mode Editing**: Switch between a user-friendly GUI and a raw JSON editor ([CodeMirror 6](https://code.haverbeke.berlin/codemirror/dev/)) with one click.
- 📂 **Local Management**: Drag & Drop your `config.json` to edit locally or use built-in presets.
- 🧩 **Smart Routing**: Advanced routing manager with Drag-and-Drop rule reordering.
- ⚖️ **Local Balancer Builder**: paste links or a subscription — or pick nodes straight from your Remnawave panel — and get a ready client config — local SOCKS/HTTP inbounds, several proxies behind one balancer, a burst/observatory probe, and a bypass list for Russian sites and leak checkers. Groups a subscription into one config per location, and can emit a Remnawave `XRAY_JSON` subscription template (with `remnawave.injectHosts`) so the panel renders the balanced config for every subscriber — including creating the hosts that deliver it, and re-opening an existing balancer to edit it.
- 📡 **Hosts editor**: edit your Remnawave hosts here — address, transport, the inbound they serve and the template they render — with saves that touch only the fields you changed.
- 📄 **Subscription Templates**: edited inside the Local Balancer, as a form or as raw JSON — the same object, two views.
- 🧷 **Snippets & Templates**: Remnawave snippet references (`{ "snippet": "NAME" }`) are recognised, resolved and editable — browse the panel's snippet library, keep your own local templates, and insert either as a reference or as an inline copy.
- 🌐 **English and Russian**: the whole interface, down to toasts and validation messages, switches from the header. Xray's own vocabulary (inbound, outbound, REALITY, sockopt) and config enum values stay in English on purpose, so what you read still matches what the JSON says.
- 😇 **Lots of tooltips**: As a developer, I know what it's like to be a stupid sunshine. Therefore, we have left hints on the main functions.

## 🧱 Issues

- Unfortunately, we cannot be certain that some parameters will not conflict with each other. If you encounter such a combination, please report it in an ISSUE, and we will simply adjust the configurator (or add a WASM validator...).

_We have addressed the issue where, for some reason, certain settings are missing from our interface, so you are free to consult the documentation and enter whatever you want in the JSON editor. UI will not override unknown variables_

## ☁️ Remnawave Connection (CORS Setup)

Since this is a **static web application** (hosted on GitHub Pages), your browser will block requests to your Remnawave server unless **CORS** is properly configured.

### Mandatory Nginx Configuration

To allow this UI to communicate with your Remnawave API, add the following block inside your `location /` in your Nginx config:

```nginx
# 1. Hide potential duplicate headers from the backend
proxy_hide_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin';
proxy_hide_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods';
proxy_hide_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers';

# 2. Allow this UI domain
add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' 'https://bropines.github.io' always;

# 3. Allow required methods (PATCH is critical for saving!)
add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS' always;

# 4. Allow required headers
add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'Authorization, Content-Type, Cache-Control, X-Requested-With' always;

# 5. Handle preflight (OPTIONS) requests
if ($request_method = 'OPTIONS') {
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' 'https://bropines.github.io' always;
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS' always;
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'Authorization, Content-Type, Cache-Control, X-Requested-With' always;
    add_header 'Access-Control-Max-Age' 1728000;
    add_header 'Content-Type' 'text/plain; charset=utf-8';
    add_header 'Content-Length' 0;
    return 204;
}
```

_Don't forget to reload Nginx:_ `nginx -s reload`

## 🛠 Installation & Dev

This project is built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Zustand**, and **Bun**.

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### 2. Run development server

```bash
bun run dev
```

### 3. Build for production

```bash
bun run build
```

### Translations

Every user-visible string goes through `t()` in `src/i18n`, keyed by its
English text. To add or fix a translation, edit `src/i18n/ru.ts`; a key with no
entry falls back to English, so nothing breaks while a language is incomplete.

```bash
bun run i18n:report
```

prints what is missing, what is stale, and what is deliberately the same in both
languages (`src/i18n/untranslated.ts` — protocol names, config enum values and
example inputs). `bun test` enforces all three.
